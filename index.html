                <li>Oceans cover about 71% of the
                    Earth’s surface.</li>
                <li>They play an important role in the
                    chemical and biological balance of

                <li>They are vital to our food security,

                <li> But human activity has troubled
                    the health of oceans. </li>
                <li> The habitats of marine mammals
                    and fish have been degraded
                    severely, with pollution responsible
                    for the mass deaths of fish,
                    mammals and corals. </li>
                <li>Organochloric pollutants,
                    pesticides, polychlorinated
                    biphenyls (PCBs) and a range of
                    other toxic pollutants accumulate
                    within fishes later moving up the
                    food chain to cause reproductive
                    disorders.</li>

                    <pre>To control the oil pollution, following methods are used
    – Skimming
    – By spreading a high density powder over the oil patch, it 
    can be sunk to the bottom.
    – Biodegradation
    – Burning
    – Using a suitable absorbing material.</pre>

            CONCLUSION

            <ul>
                <li>Oceans cover the earth’s surface about 71% and play
                    an important role in the chemical and biological
                    balance of the life on the earth. </li>
                <li>These are rich with marine resources like minerals, oil
                    and marine life and the sea food supplies meet a
                    substantial food requirement of the world’s population.</li>
                <li>If the marine life affected by the pollution and if they
                    carry pollutants in its biomass, the human population
                    may get the impact while consuming such resources.
                    Hence it is necessary to aware about the marine
                    pollution, and to protect the marine water from the
                    pollutants. So, necessary to prevent and control this
                    pollution.</li>
                <li>Let us save our oceans and the huge marine ecosystem.</li>
